== Managing Payment History

The payment history allows you to collect and manage all completed and upcoming payments, as well as download invoices. Payment amounts in the history table are specified with the account of discount coupons if applied.

=== Making a payment

The payments that have not been completed for some reasons (for example, the credit card has expired, or it is the initial payment to be made manually after the trial period), are displayed as unpaid in the **PAYMENT HISTORY** table. To complete a payment, follow these steps:

1. Click image:/interface-elements/tree-dots-button.png[] next to the payment you need to complete.
2. Select **Pay**.
   If the credit card requires authentication, you will be redirected to
   the bank web page to confirm the payment. Otherwise, the payment will
   be made automatically.
   After the payment, you will be able to download the invoice.

=== Downloading an invoice

To download an invoice, follow the steps:

1. Click next to the payment for which you want to download the invoice.
2. Select **Download invoice**.
