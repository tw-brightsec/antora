== What is Bright DAST?


https://app.neuralegion.com[Bright] is a powerful dynamic application & API security testing (DAST) platform. With its powerful
automation and integration capabilities, Bright allows developers to
scan multiple targets, uncover security vulnerabilities without false
positives, get detailed reports on every finding, and quickly fix
security issues by following the remediation guidelines.

=== Features

-  **Automatically Tests Every Aspect of Your Apps & APIs** +
   Scans any target, whether Web Apps, APIs (REST & SOAP, GraphQL &
   more), Web sockets or mobile, providing actionable reports.
-  **Spin-Up, Configure and Control Scans with Code** +
   One file. One command. One scan. No UI needed.
-  **Super-Fast Scans** +
   Interacts with applications and APIs, instead of just crawling them
   and guessing.
   Scans are fast as our AI-powered engine can understand application
   architecture and generate sophisticated and targeted attacks.
-  **No False Positives** +
   Stop chasing ghosts and wasting time. Bright doesn’t return false
   positives, so you can focus on releasing code.
-  **Comprehensive Security Testing** +
   Bright tests for all common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection,
   CSRF, XSS, and XXE - as well as uncommon vulnerabilities, such as
   business logic vulnerabilities.

=== Integration capabilities

You can integrate Bright with your development and management tools to
simplify and automate the process of testing your applications and APIs.
You can start scans, view detailed reports on every detected
vulnerability, as well as solve security issues without leaving your
development environment.

Bright enables you to configure integration with your CI pipelines or
ticketing systems by using the Bright App, CLI or API. To simplify
access the Bright account, you can also use the Single Sign On (SSO)
capabilities. Some integrations require valid predefined API keys that
you should create in the Bright App.
